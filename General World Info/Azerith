<h2 id="factions">Factions</h2>
<p>Azerith is not one nation but is instead split up into different groups called &#39;factions&#39;. Factions are essentially their nations with a leader/political system, a capital city, trade routes, and an international bureaucracy. The borders of the factions are based mostly on culture and geography, with each faction having a defining characteristic. Due to the slightly &#39;wishy-washy&#39; nature of these borders, land disputes are common. There are 5 factions in Azerith;</p>
<ol>
<li>[[Dragolith]] - A society that worships the many [[Dragons]] which are native to the area. </li>
<li>[[Lavastia]] - A faction made up primarily of forests. The people of Lavastia may live in homes on the ground, in trees, or even underground. </li>
<li>[[Transin]] - A faction in the south of Azerith, where, due to the blessings of [[The Gods#The Pantheon|Glacious]], the god of ice, it is winter all year long. </li>
<li>[[Groustia]] - A land of mostly desert and death. This is the least populated faction due to its harsh conditions. </li>
<li>[[Shallow Hills]] - A faction filled with strange mole-like hills that can be as tall as mountains. People live on, in, or even under these hills. </li>
</ol>
<p>These factions are very diverse in species due to how variable housing can be. For example folks who enjoy living underground (dwarfs, goblins, etc.) may live inside a hill in Shallow Hills, under [[The Spire]] in Dragolith, in mountains in Groustia, in underground igloos in Transin, or even in roots of large tress in Lavastia. </p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>Azerith has a very unique geography for both mundane and magical reasons. There are key landmarks, geographical features, and named locations. </p>
<h3 id="desert-tundra">Desert &amp; Tundra</h3>
<p>In the north, there is a desert that is dry all year long, while in the south, there is a tundra with nothing but snow (these geographical features are what define the borders for [[Groustia]] and [[Transin]], respectively). The reason for these harsh differences is quite mundane, as it is as simple as the climate in these specific areas. </p>
<h3 id="forests">Forests</h3>
<p>Aside from Lavastia, Azerith has many forests. The main forests are the [[Groustia#Geography|Shadowed Sky]], [[Groustia#Geography|Burning Field]], [[Transin#Geography|Alderwyn Glade]], and [[Transin#Geography|Snowy Grove]]. All of these forests are generally similar, although they are adapted to their specific climates. </p>
<h3 id="the-reani-river">The Reani River</h3>
<p>There is only one major river in Azerith (although there are, of course, many rivers). This is the Reani River, which resides in Transin. Due to the cold temperatures in Transin, it is frozen throughout the entire year (and can be completely buried in snow in the winter).</p>
<h3 id="the-gaping-maw">The Gaping Maw</h3>
<p>The Gaping Maw is a mountain range that stretches from the Northwest side of Azerith to [[Transin]]. The Gaping Maw is used as the border between [[Dragolith]] and [[Shallow Hills]] in both a political and ecological sense. Not only is the faction of Dragolith confined to the mountain range due to the treacherous journey to cross it [[Dragons]] are confined as well. </p>
<p>Only in the past 400 years was a proper path made, allowing easier access to Dragolith. Before this, the people of Dragolith were almost completely isolated from others, causing their culture to be quite different. This has opened up opportunities for trade, research, and tourism. </p>
<h3 id="the-dreadful-tide">The Dreadful Tide</h3>
<p>The Dreadful Tide is a portion of the sea that spans the Northwest of Azerith. It is known for its dangerous storms, monsters, and other horrors. Whether the danger here is simply due to coincidence or some sort of curse is unknown, but it is safe to say that everyone who enters does not return. </p>
<h3 id="sorrows-cave">Sorrows Cave</h3>
<p>Sorrows Cave is a large cave on the hillside known as Sorrows Hill. Only one person has entered this cave and come out to tell the tale. An adventurer known as Thrashia Longheart returned with strange black scars and said only &quot;the tunnels&quot; for the rest of her life. </p>
<h3 id="the-moons">The Moons</h3>
<p>There are three moons in the night sky of Azerith. The god Luna (a god of [[The Gods#The Pantheon|The Pantheon]]) has dominion over all three moons. </p>
<p>In addition to this, there is a [[The Gods#Minor Gods &amp; Spirits|Minor God]] dedicated to each moon. Legend has it that these minor gods were once mortal priests/priestesses of Luna who were rewarded with immortality. </p>
<p>The three moons have the same name as their god and also have a unique colour. The moons are;</p>
<ol>
<li>Skylight - White</li>
<li>Sealight - Blue</li>
<li>Bloodlight - Red</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The history of Azerith is long and bloody, from [[The Gods]]&#39; creation of Azerith to modern day, the history of Azerith plays a large role in modern day culture, tensions, and politics. </p>
<h3 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h3>
<p>Thousands of years and countless generations ago, [[The Gods]] created Azerith and the life that populates it. Not much is known about the exact magic used to do this, and even less is known about what preceded Azerith, but many researchers are still trying to discover more. </p>
<h3 id="the-great-war">The Great War</h3>
<p>The Great War was a worldwide war that lasted 101 years to the day, in which every faction was pitted against each other for land and resources. The leaders of the factions were power hungry and greedy; all they wanted was more land and power. Countless soldiers died in battle in place of those who were fighting. After enough uproar over the war, the leaders responsible were ousted, and new ones were appointed. </p>
<p>It&#39;s been almost 200 years since the Great War ended, and there has been an Era of Peace since. </p>
<p>All factions feel like they were not at fault for the war, and even though there has been peace since the war, there is much paranoia and anger. Due to this, most factions have large armies and focus on defensive construction in case war breaks out again. </p>
<p>Great War Timeline:</p>
<p>Began - Day of Stella 4000
Ended - Day of Stella 4101</p>
<h2 id="time">Time</h2>
<p>Time is measured differently on Azerith than it is on Earth. The days and months are longer, but weeks are shorter, and in the end, one year is the same length of time. The calendar is known as the Strackian calendar (named after the god of time, Strackia). </p>
<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>
<p>Years are the same length as they are on Earth; however, the year is split into 13 months of 28 days instead of the typical 12 months of ~30 days. In addition to this, the first day of the year is not a part of any month. It is referred to as &quot;the day of Stella&quot; and is celebrated all around the world. </p>
<p>This means that there are still 365 days in the year (28 per month + the day of Stella). </p>
<p>The months are all named after gods of [[The Gods#The Pantheon|The Pantheon]]. </p>
<ol>
<li>Day of Stella</li>
<li>Month of Luna</li>
<li>Month of Odician</li>
<li>Month of Hannoi</li>
<li>Month of Quallion</li>
<li>Month of Whisper</li>
<li>Month of Ashipia</li>
<li>Month of Graer</li>
<li>Month of Glacious</li>
<li>Month of Vandit</li>
<li>Month of Lisdron</li>
<li>Month of Systria</li>
<li>Month of Heartfelt</li>
<li>Month of Strackia</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to this, there are four main seasons in Azerith; </p>
<ul>
<li>Sunfall (Summer) - Lasts from the Day of Stella to the 28th of Quallion</li>
<li>Fruitfall (Fall/Autumn) - Lasts from the 1st of Whispers to the 28th of Graer</li>
<li>Snowfall (Winter) - Lasts from the 1st of Glacious to the 28th of Lisdron</li>
<li>Flowerfall (Spring) - Lasts from the 1st of Systria to the 28th of Strackia</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="days">Days</h3>
<p>There are 6 days in the week instead of the usual 7; however, those days are longer than the days on Earth. The days of the week are known as;</p>
<ol>
<li>Riverrun</li>
<li>Cloudblot</li>
<li>Leaflife</li>
<li>Claybuild</li>
<li>Lumbersun</li>
<li>Swordsworn</li>
</ol>
<p>Usually, stores close early or are not open at all on Swordsworn.</p>
<p>Time is still measured in seconds, minutes, hours, etc. However, days are 28 hours long instead of 24. </p>
<h3 id="celebrations">Celebrations</h3>
<p>There are many celebrations throughout the year in Azerith. Most are celebrated throughout the entire world but some are region specific. Listed are a few of the biggest and most relevant ones. </p>
<h4 id="the-day-of-stella">The Day of Stella</h4>
<p>The day of Stella is by far the biggest day of celebration in Azerith and is celebrated across the entire world. Many things are celebrated on the day of Stella, which means that people will go to many celebrations throughout the day.</p>
<p>The new year, the sunfall solstice, the anniversary of the end of the Great War, and the anniversary of the beginning of the Great War are all celebrated on this day. The fact that the Great War began on this day means that there is some mourning in addition to all of the celebration.  </p>
<p>At midnight, people will set off fireworks and celebrate the start of a new year. These celebrations are almost identical to those on Earth. Typically, people will attend the solstice parade in the morning after getting some sleep, where they attend prayers and performances. Then in the afternoon, they visit the graves of people who died in the Great War to mourn any losses. In the evening, there will often be celebrations of the end of the Great War. </p>
<h4 id="solstices-equinoxes">Solstices &amp; Equinoxes</h4>
<p>The solstices and equinoxes are celebrated very </p>
<p><strong>Sunfall Solstice</strong> - The sunfall solstice takes place on the Day of Stella. Typical celebrations include parades, performances, and prayers to [[The Gods#The Pantheon|Stella]]. </p>
<p><strong>Fruitfall Solstice</strong>  - The fruitfall solstice takes place on the 1st of Whispers. Typical celebrations include large meals with families and gathering food from nearby fields. </p>
<p><strong>Snowfall Solstice</strong> - The snowfall solstice takes place on the 1st of Glacious. Typical celebrations include snow sports (in places where it snows), small parades, and prayers to [[The Gods#The Pantheon|Glacious]]. </p>
<p><strong>Flowerfall Solstice</strong> - The flowerfall solstice takes place on the 1st of Systria. Typical celebrations include flower picking and celebrating the family. </p>
<h4 id="great-war-celebrations">Great War Celebrations</h4>
<p>The great war began on the Day of Stella 4000 after a terrorist attack in [[Living-Tree]] and ended on the Day of Stella 4101 after a peace treaty was signed. This means that on the Day of Stella, people celebrate both the end of such a violent war while also mourning the loss of loved ones who died in the war. </p>
<p>In addition to the fact that the solstice is on this day can mean there is a strange energy to the day. </p>
<h4 id="month-celebration">Month Celebration</h4>
<p>If there is a group of people who have a strong connection with one god (for example, sailors may be very connected to [[The Gods#The Pantheon|Whisper]]), they may celebrate that god on the first of the month named after them. These celebrations look very different for each god.  </p>
